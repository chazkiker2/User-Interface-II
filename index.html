          My name is Chaz Kiker. I am a student at Lambda School for the year, and I designed this website. Realistically, the concept for this page was to act as a portfolio to show off all of the unbelievably and wildly cool projects I've built. Unfortunately, this is my fourth day at Lambda aaaaaand I haven't built jack-shit quite yet (well... other than this). Thankfully, this page will remain in the depths of my finder; eventually, maybe I'll circle back to this layout and build off of it. Regardless, there will be PLENTY of projects to insert into this site (or into a brand new portfolio) within the coming months. For now, please enjoy these very cool photographs taken by people I've never met.

      <p>
        This paragraph is full of meaningless information about the non-existant
        projects on the left. Seeing as I don't have projects quite yet to add
        in a website such as this, there is really nothing to tell you about
        these projects. In fact, they are literally just pictures... pictures
        that I didn't even take. Thanks unsplash.com, you're the best.
